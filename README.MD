# SimChecklists - Interactive Checklists
This is a very simple app, to use as a checklist manager for flight simulators. 
I guess it can be applied to any checklists, like grocery shopping, but it wasn't developed for that, i made for my own flight sim checklists.

This software supports any flight simulator software, since it doesn't connect directly to the simulator. So you can use it for cross-check checklists with any flight simulator. The current version has checklists created specifically for: X-Plane 11, X-Plane 12, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (40th anniversary) and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, this software isn't affiliated with any flight simulator or any airplane maker.

## Disclaimer
None of the information or checklists in this application should be used for real-world flying. All the information here is for simulation purposes only!

## Usage

## Checklist Files
Checklist files are simple .txt files, the format is also very simple, basically 1 item per line, with a few exceptions:
- the very first line of the file is the main title (aka aircraft name)
- each new sublist (Pre-Flight, Before Takeoff, Taxi, etc) is named between double dashes (ie. --Before Flight--) also on its own line.
- each item use the format descriptive=state (ie. Parking Brake=ON). 
- to add additional information or comment to a item, add a line right below it starting with double asterisk ``` ** ```
- If you want to credit the checklist, just use --Credits-- on the very last line of the checklist file.

### Checklist Masterfile 
Due to the requirements of the offline version, a masterlist, called masterlist.json must be updated each time a new list is added, the format follows:

```
{
    "file": "a320neo.txt",
    "name": "Airbus A320neo"
},
```

Pretty much self-explanatory, but the file property is the name of the file inside /lists and the name property is the display name for the list on the first screen of the app. You can also use the included masterlist_gen.py (unsupported) to auto generate the masterfile.

### Native Versions
Currently in alpha stage, Android only and unsupported.
Windows native version in alpha stage, unsupported.

### Requirements
The code is written in Vanilla Javascript, you need to use a browser with support for ECMAScript 2019.
No need to build anything, it runs straight from the webserver.

Version 2.0 (2024/11/22)
- Converted from PHP to pure VanillaJS, this is done in preparation for the native versions of the app to be able to run offline, since embedding a local PHP server would be an overkill, so the app will entirely locally in the native versions, without the need for the device to be connected to the internet, and this still allows me to use the same codebase for all the versions, but it will require re-compiling for each plataform on the release of an update to anything (code or lists);
